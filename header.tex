\begin{abstract}
  The eikonal equation is used to model high-frequency wave
  propagation and solve a variety of applied problems in computational
  science. We present a family of fast and accurate Dijkstra-like
  solvers for the eikonal equation and factored eikonal equation,
  which compute solutions on a regular grid by solving local
  variational minimization problems. Our methods converge linearly but
  compute significantly more accurate solutions than competing
  methods, due to improved directional coverage and the use of more
  accurate quadrature rules. In 3D, we present two different families
  of algorithms which significantly reduce the number of FLOPs needed
  to solve the eikonal equation. One method employs a fast
  neighborhood search to prune unnecessary updates, and the other uses
  Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theory to achieve the same end. We conduct
  extensive numerical simulations and provide theoretical
  justification for our approach. A link to a library implementing
  these algorithms is available online at the authorsâ€™ respective
  webpages.
