\section[Minimum action integral]{Minimum actional integral for the
  eikonal equation}\label{sec:minimum-action-integral} The eikonal
equation \cref{eq:eikonal} is a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for $u$. If
we let each fixed characteristic (ray) of the eikonal equation be
parametrized by some parameter $\sigma$ and denote
$p \equiv \nabla u$, the corresponding Hamiltonian is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eikonal-hamiltonian}
  H{(p, x)} = \frac{\norm{p}^2}{2} - \frac{s(x)^2}{2} = 0.
\end{equation}
Since $H = 0$, \cref{eq:eikonal-hamiltonian} implies
$L = \sup_p (\langle p, x' \rangle - H) = s(x) \norm{x'}$. Since
$x' = \partial_p H = p$ and $\norm{p} = s(x)$ can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eikonal-lagrangian}
  L(x, x') = \langle p, x'\rangle = \langle x', x'\rangle = \langle \nabla u, x' \rangle = \frac{du}{d\sigma}.
\end{equation}

Let $x(\sigma)$ be a characteristic arriving at
$\hat{x} = x(\hat\sigma)$ from $x_0 = x(0)$, which lies on the
expanding front. Integrating from $0$ to $\hat\sigma$ and letting
$\hat u = u(\hat x)$ and $u_0 = u(x_0)$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:minimum-action-on-a-ray}
  \hat u - u_0 = \int_{0}^{\hat\sigma} L(x, x') d\sigma = \int_{0}^{\hat\sigma} s(x) \norm{x'} d\sigma = \int_0^L s(x) dl,
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the length of the characteristic from $x_0$ to $\hat{x}$
and $dl$ is the length element. A characteristic of \cref{eq:eikonal}
minimizes \cref{eq:minimum-action-on-a-ray} over admissible
paths. Then, if $\hat{x}$ is fixed and $\alpha$ is an arc-length
parametrized curve with $\alpha(L) = \hat{x}$,
\cref{eq:minimum-action-on-a-ray} is equivalent to:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eikonal-minimum-action-path}
  \hat{u} = u(\hat{x}) = \min_\alpha \curlyb{u(\alpha(0)) + \int_\alpha s(x) dl}.
\end{equation}
Our update procedure is based on
\cref{eq:eikonal-minimum-action-path}. This problem may have multiple
local minima---$\hat{u}$ above corresponds to the first arrival, which
is what interests us primarily in this work. While the standard finite
difference method effectively discretizes the Hamiltonian, the family
of methods presented here discretizes
\cref{eq:eikonal-minimum-action-path}.
