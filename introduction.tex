\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

In this work, we are interested in solving the \emph{eikonal
  equation}, a nonlinear hyperbolic PDE encountered in high frequency
wave propagation~\cite{engquist2003computational} and the modeling of
a wide variety of problems in computational and applied
science~\cite{sethian1999level}, such as photorealistic
rendering~\cite{ihrke2007eikonal}, and others. Our primary interest
stems from solving problems in high frequency acoustics
acoustics~\cite{prislan2016ray}, which are key to enabling a higher
degree of verisimilitude in virtual reality simulations
(see~\cite{raghuvanshi2014parametric,raghuvanshi2018parametric} for a
cutting-edge time-domain approach); higher accuracy leads to more
faithful results, and fast algorithms allow for more economical use.

\subsection{The eikonal equation}

With $n \geq 2$, and given a domain $\Omega \in \R^n$, the eikonal
equation is of the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eikonal}
  \norm{\nabla u(x)}_2 = s(x), \qquad x \in \Omega,
\end{equation}
where $s : \Omega \to \R_+$ is a fixed, nonnegative \emph{slowness
  function}, which forms part of the problem data. Hence, we solve for
$u : \Omega \to \overline{\R}_+$. The rest of the problem data is a
subset $D \subset \Omega$ where $u$ has been fixed; i.e.,
$\left. u \right|_D = g$ for some $g : D \to \overline{\R}_+$. As an
example, if $s \equiv 1$ and $g \equiv 0$, then the solution $u$ of
\cref{eq:eikonal} is the distance to $D$ at each point in $\Omega$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:distance-to-Omega}
  u(x) = d(x, D) = \inf_{y \in \Omega} \norm{x - y}_2.
\end{equation}
A variety of numerical methods have been proposed for the solution of
\cref{eq:eikonal}: most methods can be described as either
Dijkstra-like or fast sweeping methods, each of which is described
below.

\subsection{Results}

We develop a suite of fast Dijkstra-like solvers for the eikonal
equation in 2D and 3D, similar to the fast marching method or ordered
upwind methods~\cite{sethian1996fast,sethian2003ordered}. These
solvers come about by discretizing and minimizing the action
functional for the eikonal equation, which is a line integral. We
investigate three different quadrature rules for discretizing this
line integral: a righthand rule (\texttt{rhr}), a simplified midpoint
rule (\texttt{mp0}), and a midpoint rule (\texttt{mp1}). We also
consider ways of decomposing a grid point's neighborhood into
triangles and tetrahedra, which help us simplify and accelerate our
solvers by avoiding redundant and unnecessary computations. We extend
this algorithm to handle the locally factored eikonal equation using
an additive factorization~\cite{luo2012fast, qi2018corner}.

In 3D, to minimize the number of FLOPs required to solve
\cref{eq:eikonal}, we develop two different hierarchical
algorithms. In the first---our so-called \emph{bottom-up} algorithm,
denoted \texttt{olimhu} in the text---we either solve a system of
nonlinear equations or apply a simple Newton iteration to minimize the
action functional, depending on the quadrature rule used; this is
combined with a search for updates that starts with low-dimensional
updates and proceeds to higher ones, using information from
lower-dimensional updates to structure the search. In the second
algorithm (our \emph{top-down} algorithms, denoted \texttt{olim6},
\texttt{olim18}, and \texttt{olim26}), we quickly enumerate
neighboring simplexes and solve a collection of sequential quadratic
programs (SQPs) over the base of each.

Our main results are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item This work was done in tandem with work constructing ordered line
  integral methods for computing the quasipotential for nongradient
  stochastic differential equations
  (SDEs)~\cite{dahiya2017ordered,yang2018computing,dahiya2018ordered}. Unlike
  the quasipotential, the eikonal equation is simple enough to allow
  for analysis justifying our algorithms. We show how our quadrature
  rule relate, giving a rigorous justification of the \texttt{mp0}
  rule, establishing it as superior to \texttt{mp1} in most
  cases.
\item We provide justification for \texttt{olimhu}, showing that it
  doesn't propagate error in simple cases.
\item We conduct extensive numerical tests on a variety of problems,
  including point source problems for different slowness (index of
  refraction) functions, and multiple point source problems with
  linear speed. These problems have analytical solutions, which we use
  for comparison.
\item \textbf{\hl{TODO}}: \emph{add specific speedup factors and
    figures here once we have them}.
\end{itemize}

% We provide theoretical results establishing the validity of
% these methods and demonstrate their interrelation. We conduct
% extensive numerical experiments, which demonstrate that our solvers
% exceed the performance of existing Dijkstra-like solvers in terms of
% error measured versus CPU time (i.e., for a fixed error tolerance, our
% solvers obtain a sufficiently accurate solution in less
% time). \hl{\textbf{TODO}}: \emph{add the speedup factor here once we
%   know it.}
