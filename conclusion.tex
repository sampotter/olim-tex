\section{Conclusion} In this work, we have conducted a careful study
of semi-Lagrangian methods for solving the eikonal equation and
additively and locally factored eikonal equation, extending the
spiritual predecessor of this work, the original paper describing an
$O(N \log N)$ method for solving the eikonal equation by
Tsitsiklis~\cite{tsitsiklis1995efficient}. In particular, we:
\begin{itemize}
\item Study the \texttt{rhr}, \texttt{mp0}, and \texttt{mp1}
  quadrature rules, showing the relationship between \texttt{mp0} and
  \texttt{mp1}, and rigorously justifying methods based on
  \texttt{mp0}.
\item Demonstrate the causality of our methods and show the existence
  of an $O(N)$ algorithm based on Dial's algorithm with a large update
  gap than previously known.
\item Develop two different types of hierarchical algorithms (one
  based on solving SQPs and explicitly enumerating tetrahedra
  effectively using a lookup table, and another based on an ordered
  search of the set of tetrahedra and combined with tetrahedra
  skipping based on KKT theory) which lead to very parsimonious
  methods for update tetrahedra, thereby leading to fast algorithms.
\item Show that our method easily handles the locally factored eikonal
  equation and conduct numerical studies showing the effect of
  different choices of local factoring radii on convergence.
\end{itemize}
In a future work, we will explore the parallel implementation of this
method using Dial's algorithm and consider its application to problems
in high frequency wave propagation.
