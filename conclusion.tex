\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we develop two families of fast and accurate direct
solvers for the eikonal equation. One of these relies on enumerating
valid update simplexes, while the other employs a fast search for the
first arrival characteristic. These algorithms use several different
quadrature rules (\texttt{mp0}, \texttt{mp1}, and \texttt{rhr}). We
analyze the relationship between these quadrature rules and establish
guarantees on their error. We also conduct extensive numerical tests
exploring these algorithms runtime and error, also comparing them to
the standard fast marching method, showing that only a very modest
slowdown is incurred. To get a sense of the relative time spent by our
algorithms on different tasks, we also profile our algorithms,
separating the time spent into several coarse-grained categories. As a
result of this, we suggest that the emphasis on seeking an $O(N)$
algorithm may be misplaced.

In future works, we plan on extending this work to handle
Hamilton-Jacobi solvers, explore more quadrature rules, and
investigate the effect of directional coverage on solution
accuracy. Our numerical tests also suggest that knowledge of the
update gap may allow us to parallelize a Dijkstra-like solver.
