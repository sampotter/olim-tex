** Introduction
   - [ ] Add a plot which contains "the gist" of our results
*** Applications
	- [ ] shape from shading
	- [ ] noise removal
	- [ ] geodesic distance computation
	- [ ] high frequency wavefront propagation
	- [ ] signed distance function computation in level set methods
	- [ ] travel times in seismic tomography
** Numerical results
   - [ ] Add section based on PGO indicating relative time spent in
     different sections of the code
	 - [ ] Make a stacked graph showing percentages vs. N
	 - [ ] Use this to make the point that using Dijkstra's algorithm
       leads to an algorithm which is ~N for almost all practical
       problem sizes
	 - [ ] Compare this with what Whittaker says about the log(N) cost
       of the method being expensive
   - [ ] Reduce the number of plots
   - [ ] Compare basic_marcher_3d and olim6_rhr runtimes as N
     increases. It looks like it might be the case that olim6_rhr
     achieves parity for larger N. Can add a section explaining why
     this may be the case---probably has to do with memory transfers
     starting to dominate.
	 - [ ] May also be worth comparing on two different computes to
       see the effect of cache sizes...
   - [ ] Add a shape from shading test?
